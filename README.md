# Introduction

This is a simple Python script that sends an email to a list of people declared in a CSV and personalize the email with the name, which is also in the CSV.

To use this script you have to:
  * Activate access to less safe applications in Gmail (as it uses SMTP it is required)
  * Write the email in email.txt where {} is where you want the program to write the name
  * Write the name of the person in the 1st column of the CSV and the email in the 2nd column, starting in the second line of the CSV
